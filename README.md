# Cryptograhy Themed Programs

Each of these programs are written by me, and display my skills of an amateur programmer. 

base64_five_time.py:
 
This program encodes the string 5 times in base64 format, each encode after the first uses the string from the
previous encoding to do the job. The program has a encryption and decryption method so you will be able to encode and 
decode. 

user_pw_generator.py:

This program outputs 5 random usernames and passwords. The usernames start with "user", and is proceeded with random characters. 
The password part is about the same, but is totally random and is 20-25 characters long. 

rotbase_program.py:

This program encodes the string in rotate 13, then into base64. Then using the decryption feature, you can input the string just encoded
to execute the decoding/decryption process. Like the first program, this has an encode, and decode method.
